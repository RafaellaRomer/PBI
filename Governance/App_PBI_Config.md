## Navigation and Configuration PBI App - Possibilities

List of Possibilities for your Power BI Application:
•	✅ Create a Centralized and Functional Menu: Use a Dashboard as your main homepage and add Tiles to link to all your reports. This ensures that the navigation is internal (in the same tab).
•	✅ Navigate Internal Pages: Use the "Page Navigation" action type in Power BI Desktop to move between the tabs of the same report.
•	✅ Organize the Side Menu: Use the Content section when editing the App to group and reorder your reports in the navigation menu that appears to the user.
•	✅ Share with Specific Audiences: Use the Audience section to show specific reports to different user groups (via Active Directory/Security Groups).
List of Limitations (What we couldn't achieve):
•	❌ Use the "Web URL" action on a button to navigate between App reports without opening a new tab.
•	❌ Guarantee that any URL with the https:// protocol (even from Power BI) is rendered internally when used with the "Web URL" action on a button.
